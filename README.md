# MyBLEMeshNetwork

MyBLEMeshNetwork is a library for creating a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh network using ESP32 devices. This library allows devices to communicate with each other in a mesh topology, making it suitable for applications such as IoT, home automation, and sensor networks.

## Features

- **Mesh Communication**: Allows ESP32 devices to send and receive messages within a mesh network.
- **Node Management**: Automatically manages active nodes in the network and removes inactive nodes.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for sending and receiving messages.

## Installation

1. **Download the Library**: Clone the repository or download it as a ZIP file.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyBLEMeshNetwork.git

2. Add to Arduino Libraries: Move the MyBLEMeshNetwork folder to your Arduino libraries directory, typically found at:

Windows: Documents\Arduino\libraries

macOS: Documents/Arduino/libraries

Linux: ~/Arduino/libraries



3. Restart Arduino IDE: Close and reopen the Arduino IDE to refresh the libraries.



Usage

Include the Library

To use the library in your Arduino sketch, include it as follows:

#include <BLEMeshNetwork.h>

Create an Instance

Create an instance of the BLEMeshNetwork class:

BLEMeshNetwork meshNetwork("YourDeviceName");

Initialize the Network

In your setup() function, initialize the network:

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
    meshNetwork.begin();
}

Sending Messages

To send a message to a specific destination:

meshNetwork.sendMessage("Hello, World!", "DestinationNodeID");

Receiving Messages

Set a callback function to handle received messages:

void onMessageReceived(const std::string& message, const std::string& sender) {
    Serial.print("Received from ");
    Serial.print(sender.c_str());
    Serial.print(": ");
    Serial.println(message.c_str());
}

void setup() {
    ...
    meshNetwork.onReceiveMessage(onMessageReceived);
}

Remove Inactive Nodes

Periodically call the removeInactiveNodes() method to clean up inactive nodes:

void loop() {
    meshNetwork.removeInactiveNodes();
    delay(1000);
}

Example

An example sketch is provided in the examples directory. To test the library:

1. Open the example sketch:

File > Examples > MyBLEMeshNetwork > Example.ino



2. Upload it to your ESP32 device.


3. Open the Serial Monitor to view the communication logs.



Library Structure

The library is organized as follows:

Customization Notes

Replace yourusername in the clone URL and project repository link with your GitHub username.

Update the project description, features, and any specific instructions to reflect your library's functionality and use case accurately.

Consider adding badges (like build status, license, etc.) at the top of the README for better visibility and professionalism.


### Changes Made:
1. Corrected the Markdown formatting for code blocks and lists.
2. Added missing backticks and consistent indentation.
3. Organized sections clearly with headings and proper bullet points.
4. Ensured all code snippets are properly enclosed in triple backticks for readability.

This structure should be clear and user-friendly for anyone looking to understand and use your library.
